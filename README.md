Full Stack Web Performance
==========================

Abstract
--------

> Modern users expect more than ever from web applications. Unfortunately, they are also consuming applications more frequently from low bandwidth and low power devices – which strains developers not only to nail the user experience, but also the application’s performance.

> Join Nik Molnar, co-founder of the open source debugging and diagnostics tool Glimpse, for an example-driven look at strategies and techniques for improving the performance of your web application all the way from the browser to the server.

> We’ll cover how to use client and server side profiling tools to pinpoint opportunities for improvement, solutions to the most common performance problems, and some suggestions for getting ahead of the curve and actually surpassing user’s expectations.

> This session covers a wide array of topics, most of which would be classified within the 200 level.
